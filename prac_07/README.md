# Practical 07

## About this repository

This repository contains all practicals from week 1 to week 10
for [Cp-1404](https://github.com/00079-wailinn/cp1404practicals).
I am a student from CP-1404 (Programming 2).My name is Wai Linn Aung. I am currently learning Cybersecurity at JCU.

## 3 Main Lessons I learnt about clean code

- Naming variables: Naming should be meaningful and use specific variable,function,class to make the code easy to
  understand.
- Avoid repeating code:Use functions, loops, or constants to eliminate duplication and make code more maintainable.
- Single Responsibility Principal(SRP): Functions should not usually print unless that's their one thing.
